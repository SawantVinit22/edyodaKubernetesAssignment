Voting-App demo Assignment

Deleting the vote pod and worker pod has no effects on the working application it works fine
Deleting the db pod results into the result app stops working

The result app stopped working because socket connection was lost as dB was down and when db was up the result app still was trying to connect to the
previous connection which did not exist 

The solution is to restart the result pod . 



kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-gqmbm
pod "vote-94849dc97-gqmbm" deleted
^C

kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-dg27b
pod "worker-dd46d7584-dg27b" deleted


kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-fc44m
pod "db-b54cd94f4-fc44m" deleted
^C
